Hi! I'm currently studying a B.S Biology at the University of Cauca. I'm the Development Biology and Neural Plasticity Research Seedbed Coordinator. I served as a Monitor at the Herbarium of the Natural History Museum of the University of Cauca. I have a deep interest in neurobiology and bioinformatics.
